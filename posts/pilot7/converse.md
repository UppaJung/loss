One way to ask about harms is to ask about events that caused harm or loss (e.g., a compromise or lockout) with follow-ups about the harm that was the consequence of those events (e.g., lost data). 

We might get different results were we to do the converse, asking about the harms people have experienced with follow-ups about the events that caused those harms.

Now, instead of asking you how you might have suffered loss, we're going to ask two final questions about what you may have lost.

## Loss of digital photos or videos

The following two questions ask you about digital photos or videos you may have lost. We will ask you how many videos you have lost over your lifetime and the events that led to their loss.

*How many photos or videos have you lost over your lifetime?*

  🔘 I have never lost any photos or videos \
  🔘 More than five years of photos and/or videos \
  🔘 More than one year of photos and/or videos, but less than five years \
  🔘 More than one month of photos and/or videos, but less than one year \
  🔘 More than one week of photos and/or videos, but less than one month \
  🔘 More than one day of photos and/or videos, but less than one week \
  🔘 Less than one day of photos and/or videos \

*Please rate how valuable these lost photos or videos were to you on a scale of 1 (none will be missed) to 7 (some were priceless).*

How valuable were these photos to you?*
  🔘 They included irreplaceable memories of events or people \
