### Stuart's notes on reading loss stories.

Lots of great loss stories. Worth the read. After reading, participant 22 and 49, they seem most likely to be the result of feeding the questions into an LLM (large language model). Participant 46 did not answer initial questions in a meaningful way.

A number of respondents describe events that happened to friends or loved ones. We may want to emphasize that they should only harms due to themselves or due to their own reliance on technology. (Good meeting discussion topic.)

### Changes for analysis

 - Integrate the classification(s) assigned into the page describing the stories.
 
 - Merge graphs for accounts when same questions asked for email, social, and financial

### Ideas for next pilot
Possible scenarios:
 - Lost attention, wasted time, and addiction
 - Harassment, bullying, impersonation, or embarrassment (or exposure to others being harassed, bullied, impersonated, or embarrassed)
 - Harms due to others' use of, reliance on, or addiction to technology?
 - Social distance as interactions become less personal
 - Navigation and scheduling failures?
 - General mental health decline?
 - General social decline?


## Results

There were {{ data.numberOfParticipants }} participants in this pilot.

Participants started by writing [loss stories](./loss-stories.md) about the three worst technology-related harms they had experienced. 


We then told participants we would "describe technology-related harms that that have happened to others, and ask if they have also happened to" them.

When participants reported having suffered one of the described scenarios, we asked them how recently they had experienced it.

We asked participants who had a device compromised/stolen or locked what type of device it was. (If they had experienced more than one incident of a scenario we asked about the worst.)
