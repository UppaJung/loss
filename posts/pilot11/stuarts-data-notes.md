#### Participant (PID ending 184) **Removed from data following message with participant**
  - Provide three things that were not personal harm descriptions for the three harms
  - Matched abuse and lost photos to items those descriptions that were not harms
  - Responded to lost emails: "Yes, and while I did not describe it above, I should have ranked it my most harmful", then, when asked how many emails were lost, responded "I have never lost any emails".

We sent
> Hi. Before processing payment, I'm reviewing your response to the survey about online harms. Your written answers for the three worst instances of "harm or loss you have experienced" do not appear to be about anything you report to have experienced personally. When you connected other questions to those essay answers, we cannot make sense of them. For example, "the technologies you or others rely on [being] used to embarrass or harass you" does not seem to be part of "Reduced attention and symptoms of ADHD". Can you help us make sense of your response?

They replied
> Hi sir if you find any issue please let me know I will return my submission.

We sent
> Returning the submission seems reasonable. Thanks.

The participant returned the submission. We added a filter to remove their data from our results at the first stage of processing.

#### Participant 19 (PID ending d78)
  - Replied that they had lost photos/videos, checking the cause as "A phone storing the photos/videos was stolen"
  - Replied no to "Have you had a personal electronic device stolen, used by someone without your permission, used in a way that you did not permit or later regretted permitting, or otherwise compromised (hacked)?"
  - Replied that social was hacked in that "The account was used by someone I knew with my permission, but they used it in a way that they knew I would not want" which associated with their written response "When my data was used to steal my identity and people were using my password and credentials to do criminal activities"
  - Yet, seems to have put effort in. Took time to write "Tons of my friends were sent thousands of spam messages from my account and I had to warn them about it"
  - "The account was used by someone I knew without my permission"

> Thanks for participating in our survey. I am writing to request a clarification. When asked how you had lost photos/videos, you checked "A phone storing the photos/videos was stolen". When asked "Have you had a personal electronic device stolen, used by someone without your permission, used in a way that you did not permit or later regretted permitting, or otherwise compromised (hacked)", you selected "No, and I do not worry that this might happen to me in the future". Can you clarify whether you had a phone stolen and help us resolve this inconsistency?

They replied:
> Yes I had phone stolen and it was my designated company work phone. It was stolen from my car. I selected no I do not worry about this happening in the future because I no longer have a work phone because my company discontinued that program. I hope that makes sense

Perhaps we should ask who the "someone I knew" is in these situations?

#### Other participant notes

Participant 21, perhaps a lost opportunity in matching (missed broken promise)

Participant 23 had odd matchings (maybe age related at 67?), missed broken promise

Participant 24, not great matchings (missed broken promise)

Participant 28, lots of work-related (not personal) stories

### Learnings

The broken promise topic seems to be written in a way that isn't leading to matches.
