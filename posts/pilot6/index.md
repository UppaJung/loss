There were {{ data.numberOfParticipants }} participants in this pilot.

Participants started by writing [loss stories](./loss-stories.md) about the three worst technology-related harms they had experienced.


We then told participants we would "describe technology-related harms that that have happened to others, and ask if they have also happened to" them.

  <figcaption>The percent of participants who had experienced each harm scenario. Losses due to failures of security measures to protect participants from attack are paired (left bar) against harms due to security measures themselves harming participants (right bar).</figcaption>

When participants reported having suffered one of the described scenarios, we asked them how recently they had experienced it.

We asked participants who had a device compromised/stolen or locked what type of device it was. (If they had experienced more than one incident of a scenario we asked about the worst.)
