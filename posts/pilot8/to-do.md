 - Merge three initial options for image/email loss (none, less than day, less than week>)
 - Add matching questions to harm-first scenarios (photos/videos and emails)?
 - Add music as a loss category? (maybe not worth it?)
 - Get permission to store prolific IDs for more fair payment?

 - Track whether the probability a respondent acknowledges that something happened to them goes down as the question is later in the list as exposed to them (their random order).  Good student project!

 - Add a how graph over all hacked accounts
 - Add a how graph over all locked accounts.
