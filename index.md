We started this research with the observation that we know far less about the scale of collective harm we suffer from security technologies backfiring against us than we do about security technologies failing to protect us from others (breaches). For example, we know more about how many people's email or social accounts are broken into than how many people are permanently locked out of them.

Backfires are rarely reported or measured because there is no legislation requiring that backfires be reported, as there is for breaches; most backfires impact one user at a time, at a scale too small to be newsworthy; and users often blame themselves. The companies that build and deploy security technologies rarely suffer consequences when their products backfire—measuring and reporting backfires could only call attention to their products' potential for harm.

Yet, security technologies can cause as much harm when they backfire as when they are breached; they can prevent us from accessing and services at times of critical need, or even permanently.

As our research team set out to gauge the scale of the collective harm we suffer from security technologies backfiring, we realized we lacked a baseline for the harm we collectively suffer from all the ways in which we have come to rely on technology. And so, we designed a survey to investigate two complementary questions:

<style>
	ol ol { list-style-type: lower-alpha; } and ol ol ol { list-style-type: lower-roman; }
</style>
<ol>
<li>What are the worst experiences people have with technology failing us, being used against us, or otherwise causing harm?</li>
<li>How much collective harm is caused by security technologies backfiring...
		<ol>
		<li>as compared to the harms that result from those technologies being breached, and</li>
		<li>as compared to the broader harms that result from technology failing us, being used against us, or otherwise causing harm?</li>
		</ol>
</li>
</ol>

And so, we surveyed people to ask about 13 experiences they may or may not have suffered, as well as three harms that need not be attributed to a single specific experience. We asked about both breaches and backfires of the security protecting their (1/2) devices, (3/4) email accounts, (5/6) social media accounts, (7/8) financial accounts, and (9/10) stored passwords (password manager accounts)—a total of ten events (five breach experiences each paired with a backfire experience). Another three were experiences that were not specifically security related and did not have breach/backfire pairings: (11) losing data when replacing a device (e.g., upgrading a phone), (12) having technology fail or behave in a way other than what was promised/expected, and (13) having technology used to abuse, harass, or embarrass them. The three harms we asked about that need not be connected to a specific experience were (14) permanently losing photos, (15) permanently losing emails, and (16), experiencing mental distress or health issues connected with their use of technology.

Figure 1 displays the fraction of participants who reported these harmful experiences (1-13) and harms (14-16), broken down by the severity of the resulting harm they experienced (the sub bars).

Each bar is broken down into colors by the Likert severity of harm each participant reported on a Likert scale.</figcaption><b>Figure 1</b>

To determine which 16 experiences and harms to ask about, and to better understand how they represent the possible experiences and harms that might be attributed to our increasing reliance technology, we structured our survey by asking participants to describe the three most harmful technology-related events they had suffered. When we later asked about the 16 experiences and harms, we would then ask participants whether they had listed these harms in those initial three descriptions. See Figure 2.

  <figcaption>The percent of participants who reported experiencing events causing harms (the 13 bars on the left) or technology-related harms that they did not need to associate with specific events (the 3 bars on the right). Losses due to failures of security measures to protect participants from attack are paired (left bar) against harms due to security measures themselves harming participants (right bar). Each bar is broken down into colors based on whether the participant connected the experience/harm to one of the three worst experiences they described at the start of the study ("original"), whether they said they should have included the experience/harm as one of their three worst ("revised"), or whether it did not warrant a position in their top three ("not worst"). Those that had suffered the experience/harm are broken down into those who believe the harm could or could not happen to them.</figcaption><b>Figure 2</b>
