This research began with the observation that security technologies can fail in two ways, only one of which is typically measured:
 - security technologies can be *breached*, failing to protect their users from attackers, or
 - security technologies can *backfire*, locking out the very users they were intended to protect.

We can suffer as much harm when security backfires as when security is breached; we can lose access to data and services at times of critical need, or lose access forever. Yet, when security backfires those in a position to report and measure these events rarely do: unlike breaches, there is no legislation requires the companies that produce security technologies, or those that deploy them, to report when they backfire; occurrences impact one user at a time; and users often blame themselves. The companies that build and deploy these technologies are rarely impacted by backfires, and measuring and reporting them could only reduce confidence in their products.

As our research team set out to gauge how frequently security technologies backfire and how much harm users experience as a result, we realized we lacked a broader context for how much harm we suffer from all the ways in which the technologies we have come to rely on can fail or be used against us. And so, we designed a survey to investigate two complementary questions:

<style>
	ol ol { list-style-type: lower-alpha; } and ol ol ol { list-style-type: lower-roman; }
</style>
<ol>
<li>What are the worst experiences people have with technology failing us or being used against us?</li>
<li>How much harm is caused by security technologies backfiring...
		<ol>
		<li>as compared to the harms that result from those technologies being breached, and</li>
		<li>as compared to the broader harms that result from technology failing us or being used against us?</li>
		</ol>
</li>
</ol>
