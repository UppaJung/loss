### Language consistency

#### Relying on technology vs. technology failing
In our survey, we currently describe the topic of our study as relating to *reliance* on technology.

In the advertisement
> We are studying ways in which people's reliance on technology can cause them harm. We will ask you to recall and describe up to three experiences in which you suffered significant harm or loss due to your reliance on technology.

In the consent:
> experiences in which you suffered significant harm or loss due to your reliance on technology.

Before asking about the three-worst harms
> For the first three questions, please recall the three most harmful technology-related harms or losses you have experienced.

On our website, we use language that more firmly suggests two categories of what can go wrong:
> What are the worst experiences people have with technology failing us or being used against us?
