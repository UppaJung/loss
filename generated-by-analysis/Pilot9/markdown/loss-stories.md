### Participant 1
1. I have suffered sleep deprivation due to technology that has really negatively affected my life. Ruins sleep schedules that are important in day to day life. Have problems even staying awake in the middle of activities.
2. Eye strain is a massive harmful issue as well. Eyes become so sore and bothersome after dealing with tech for so long especially work related issues. Increased headaches from dealing with bright screens all day.
3. I think it also leads to increased stress levels after longer exposure. Just trying to even understand it sometimes and or how something is meant to be used can lead to stress levels rising.


### Participant 2
1. The most harmful is the impact on my mental health because of isolation, especially during the COVID-19 shut down and since then.
2. The second most harmful is the physical harm on my body from utilizing technology. Specifically, severe back pain and carpal tunnel.

2. *Participant matched this with* **Hacked Social, Abuse**
I was verbally assaulted on a dating app because I refused to send naked photos. We had only been messaging for a few hours, and he blew up when I said no. I hadn&#39;t met this person and he found my other social media profiles. He DM&#39;d my mom on Facebook and sent her five paragraphs about how horrible I was and how she should be ashamed of me. He threatened to find out where I lived and I had to get the police involved.
3. *Participant matched this with* **Abuse**
Someone posted photos they took of me when I was intoxicated at a party without my consent. They tagged me in the photos and refused to take them down or untag me. My boss saw the photos and I was written up for &quot;&quot;unprofessional online behavior.&quot;&quot;

### Participant 6
1. The biggest one is depression. I have access to see what everyone has. It makes me envious. I spend a lot of time thinking that I’m not doing well enough vs. what I see in social media.
2. The second is lost if trust. My spouse has constant access to people. I spend time worry about if they are talking to someone else.
3. The third is losing time with my kids. I am constantly distracted by technology. I know I should put it down and have fun with my kids but it sucks me back in. It’s a harmful addiction that’s hard to break.


### Participant 7
1. *Participant matched this with* **Locked Account, Lost Photos, Lost Emails**
i had a google account that got deleted for no apparent reason. this gmail account stored a lot of information and had many personal messages. i tried contacting google however they did not help
2. i was taking an AP exam during the coronavirus time where tests were online, however my device ran into an error which caused the test to show an invalid screen. i had to contact the collegeboard within the time allotted to ensure my test responses werent deleted, especially as the test was nearing the end of time.
3. *Participant matched this with* **Locked Account, Lost Photos, Lost Emails**

### Participant 9
1. *Participant matched this with* **Broken Promise**
I was working for a company writing technical documents. I was supposed to upload them all to the server through a company program. Whenever I submitted one, it said it was successfully uploaded. Eventually I was called into my boss&#39; office and told I was being let go for not completing my work. This was baffling, as I could show I had completed it - the documents were still saved locally and showed their dates. It turned out to be an issue with the program itself, but I was still let go as the work was not received on time.
2. I developed severe issues with carpal tunnel due to repetitive movement and odd position during work on the computer. I had to wear a brace, and do physical therapy for months. I also had to take significant time off work. It was almost a situation where I was going to need surgery, but that ended up not being the case.
3. *Participant matched this with* **Broken Promise, Lost Photos**
At once point, I had all my photos saved on a computer. This was before the cloud, so the only way to back it up would have been to an external hard drive. Unfortunately, the drive failed and I lost years of precious memories that I can never recover. Had I backed them up multiple places or had them printed, it wouldn&#39;t have happened.


### Participant 10
1. One of the most damaging technology-related mishaps I faced was inadvertently sending an email to the wrong group of people. This mistake had a profound impact on my workplace reputation and how my supervisor perceived me. Moreover, the school principal encountered considerable resistance from both parents and students due to this incident. Consequently, my contract was not renewed at the end of the school year.
2. The second most harmful incident I experienced involved sending an offensive text to the wrong person. Unfortunately, it turned out to be the individual I was discussing, leading them to realize I wasn&#39;t their friend. This realization deeply hurt their feelings.  They never spoke to me again. To this day I do not say anything negative to people in texts.
3. The third instance of harm caused by technology occurred when I mistakenly clicked on the wrong link in an email, providing personal information under the assumption that I was on the legitimate Lord and Taylor website. Fortunately, I didn&#39;t lose any money as the transaction was promptly halted by the fraud detection program when I used a credit card.
