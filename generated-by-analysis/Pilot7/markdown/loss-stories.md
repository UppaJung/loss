### Participant 1
1. The most harmful would have to be when Texas had a freeze that disabled most electricity. There was no heaters, no ways to contact family, and transportation was basically disabled since it was dangerous to drive.

2. The second most harmful would have to be mid state travelling and my phone dying so I couldn&#39;t use GPS, since my sense of direction is horrible I was panicking until I found a place to rest and charge since I never invested in a car charger at that time.

3. Third most harmful or rather loss would have to be finishing up a college assignment the due date of, which was unfortunately a stormy day so after finishing up 70%~ the electricity cut off and my last save was only about 30%~ back.

### Participant 2
1. playing video games as a child and losing sleep, because it has affected my sleeping schedule even now. I feel like my health is worse because of it.

2. my friend&#39;s in high school using technology to bully me, but never doing it in person. If technology wasn&#39;t a thing that would&#39;ve been avoided. I like to think anyways.

3. When I was a child there were chain emails that would go around that would show extremely graphic content. I was a child so I was curious and saw some horrid things that an adult shouldn&#39;t watch let alone a child.

### Participant 3
1. I have found myself ignoring other members of my family (children) while using technology.

2. I have personally experienced damage to my eyes due to over use of technology - phone, computer, tablet, etc.

3. Relationship loss - becuase of technology, there have not been as many reasons to see friends or family in person.  We are able to constantly communicate electronically.

### Participant 4
1. I consider collection, sharing, and use of my personal information in ways against my interests to be a technology-related harm. For example, retailers, banks, and payment networks collect detailed data about everything I purchase, and then use that information in ways against my interests, such as targeting me ads, selling or sharing the data, and making decisions with the data that may be against my interests, such as choosing which products to stock or where to locate a new store.

2. I feel that technology and products are developing in a way that is reducing user control and autonomy. An increasing number of products and services are cloud-based, and I have had a number of experiences where companies go out of business, or remove features or products, and I no longer feel like I control the technology that I own. For example, I use iMessage to contact friends and family, but am not able to export my chats easily or access my messages on non-Apple products, and my messaging activity is used for on-device recommendations that I cannot easily control

3. I have had data stored by numerous companies, such as T-Mobile and Comcast, that has been exposed in data breaches. In most cases, these companies should not have collected so much data in the first place, but now that my data has been collected and leaked, I need to worry about whether it is used improperly.

### Participant 5
1. When I would post on social media and TikTok and received hate comments and not what I was expecting from a video and it impacted my mental health.

2. When I received an email from a credit card check and it showed that some scam bank account had been decreasing my credit score and that bank had been reported many times and nothing from the company was done about it.

3. My phone breaking and loosing all my data and information.

### Participant 6
1. I once lost a bunch of photos and documents from a cloud service. It was incredibly frustrating, and I was very upset since it&#39;s very difficult (or impossible) to recover them once they&#39;ve been permanently deleted.

2. My airpods started to malfunction, which was frustrating because they are expensive and I use them all the time.

3. I purchased new airpods and they didn&#39;t work with my TV, which is one of the main ways that I use airpods. It was irritating since my current airpods work well with my TV but they are no longer working as well as they should.

### Participant 7
1. Not being able to sleep and staying up too late.

2. Loss of interest in other activities and decreased attention span as someone who already has adhd.

3. Less able to focus on giving my kids attention.

### Participant 8
1. Online bullying and harassment via someone obtaining my phone number and engaging in hate speech, such as racial slurs.

2. I have also experienced sexual harassment via the cellphone as well from some one messaging me as a “wrong number” mistake and then attempting to engage in sexually explicit conversation.

3. I have experienced social media bullying with negative comments and blocking.

### Participant 9
1. Multiple car accidents as a result of phone use

2. An account part of data breach which ended up leading to many accounts I’ve had, for years, being attempted to be logged into. Very difficult of a situation to clean up. Definitely had my information breached and published on the dark web, or another space for hackers. My information is still out there to this day because I still receive occasional 2FA emails.

3. My phone’s screen cracking and becoming inoperable after a few months, locking itself, and causing me lose years of old photos

### Participant 10
1. I think I have not experienced major harm. One of the biggest effects on my mental health is the loss of time/feeling of &quot;&quot;unpopularity&quot;&quot;/disconnection. I feel ugly and isolated from others.

2. My personal information being leaked, ie the equifax breach. I haven&#39;t seen many consequences because I am personally very attentive to my information, but I have definitely seen attempts to hack my accounts, experienced fraud, etc.

3. I do think online shopping has a negative effect on me and my life. I spend more money than I would otherwise.

### Participant 11
1. As someone with an attention disorder, I would say the biggest technology-related harm I&#39;ve experienced personally is an addiction to the constant stimulation of social media and other apps that in the past has greatly affected everything from school to my work. It is still something I struggle with to some degree and I have to take precautions not to waste hours at a time of my day using devices when I have other responsibilities I need to take care of.

2. The misuse of my data by big technology companies is something that I consider fairly harmful. Like a lot of people, I get hundreds of spam emails and calls due to companies selling my personal information, and I have also had account security breaches for the same reasons.

3. I was part of the first generation of kids to grow up with the internet at their disposal, and I believe it exposed me to a lot of things as a young kid that I was not ready to be exposed to which caused some fear and negative emotions. These things include adult content, violent content, or just otherwise content that should not be viewed by anyone under 18.

### Participant 12
1. The most harmful technology loss that I’ve experienced was when my laptop was stolen, and all of my social medias and banking information was compromised.

2. The second most harmful type of technology related loss that I’ve experienced was intellectual infringement on art that I had created that was being sold for profit by another company.

3. The third most harmful technology related loss that I’ve experienced a breach on a popular website that resulted in identity theft.

### Participant 13
1. My mother had her bank information &quot;&quot;hacked&quot;&quot; resulting in new bank information having to be acquired, her laptop repaired, and lots more security to all of her accounts.

2. I believe that my info was leaked or stolen by a skimmer at a gas station (this happened many years ago). No attacks to my bank information occurred and no money was lost.

3. I had info leaked via A credit reporting agency, the agency offered one year of watching my credit report as compensation but no loans, or credit cards were taken in my name.

### Participant 14
1. This might be silly, but I immediately remember missing spenidng time with my dad when I was in middle school because I was too busy talking to my friends on AOL Instant Messenger. He moved out a few weeks later (unrelated) and I wish I would&#39;ve spent that extra time with him.

2. Towards the end of college, my laptop crashed while I was working on my senior thesis. I went into full panic mode and almost had a complete breakdown. I sent out a massive group text to anyone and everyone that I thought might be able to help - including my ex boyfriend. Thankfully my friends were able to recover everything in the end.

3. I was one of the last people in my friend group to get a smart phone. While they were communicating with each other via apps, I was left out of the conversation.

### Participant 15
1. I have had my identity stolen and money loss as a result.

2. Online bullying.

3. People hacking my accounts

### Participant 16
1. I used my debit card in Target and they had a data breach, all my money was stolen by someone in China.

2. Pornography, addictive and dehumanizing

3. Media propaganda

### Participant 17
1. I have been a victim of bullying on social media due to my appearance. Because I am black, I wore my hair in it&#39;s natural state until I was in the 10th grade. I also had braces. I would be made fun of on social media websites for being black, would be called names like &quot;&quot;celie&quot;&quot; (the color purple) due to my hair texture and made fun of because of my braces.

2. I have been threatened on a few occasions by people I do not know on social media. The most recent event I can think of is an incident (in high school) where I received messages on AIM (throwback!) from someone I didn&#39;t know threatening to come to my school and fight me. On another occasion, a man I didn&#39;t know threatened me after his friend wrote racist slurs on my friend&#39;s social media page.

3. Physical harms: I have dry eyes due to them being strained from being on my computer from my job, I wear blue light glasses, I often get back, shoulder neck pain from lack of posture due to being on my computer/phone, and lack of physical activity overall during the workday.

### Participant 18
1. I have lost a document I spent a lot of time working on. This was an important work document that I was on a time crunch to complete. Composing the document required me to look up many facts, figures, and consult many different coworkers across several disciplines. I lost several hours of work and had to redo the document.

2. I took great care of my iPhone 8. It was in perfect condition. However, Apple discontinued security updates on this model so I had to buy a new phone. It was a loss of several hundred dollars.

3. I have had friends post unflattering pictures of me on social media. I don’t think they intended me harm, but maybe didn’t fully think through the impact of posting unflattering pictures of me. I have asked people to remove pictures or just I tagged myself from them.

### Participant 19
1. I lost pictures when my iPhone broke. It wasn’t backed up so every picture I had on it was just gone. There were hundreds including some of the last pictures I took of my mom who has since passed away.

2. I had a privacy breech a couple years ago and my bank account was hacked. I had quite a bit of money stolen and it all stemmed back to a website I used and entered my banking info on.

3. I think technology has been the reason my relationship failed. There are too many accessible ways for people to be dishonest and unfaithful without getting caught

### Participant 20
1. I was traveling to an important job interview. This job had the potential to be life-changing. I was told that the interview was mostly a formality, and that the people doing the interview just wanted to speak with me so that they could get a feel for me before proceeding with the steps to officially onboard me. The location they wanted me to go to was a bit further than where I usually drive to, and in a location I typically don&#39;t go, so I was unfamiliar with it. I typically rely on my phone&#39;s GPS and navigation software to direct me where to go, as I am not particularly good with directions. En route to my interview, my phone died (I made the mistake of not having a full charge, and unbeknownst to me, my phone charger wasn&#39;t charging my phone properly), and without GPS I immediately started getting lost. I had to pull over at the next strip mall I saw just to buy a new charger to get my phone going again for navigation, but because of the delay this caused, I was late to my interview. Being late to the interview caused the interviewers to have a less than favorable view of me, which led to me being turned down from the job.

2. I met someone online in a forum meant for meeting people. We chatted and seemed to have good chemistry. Eventually, we began exchanging explicit photos with one another with the intent of meeting up. This person then threatened to send the photos I sent them to people I knew and my work if I didn&#39;t give them money to not do so. I was eventually able to work something out, but from then on, I have become wary of talking with others.

3. From frequent use of my phone, my vision has started to deteriorate in a noticeable way. Shifting from viewing something close (like my phone) to something further away (like the TV) now takes longer to focus than before.

### Participant 21
1. Become lost on remote roads with no services nearby due to relying on cell service/maps.

2. Had somewhat valuable camera lenses essentially stolen from me through online selling services.

3. Migraines due to overuse on large screen monitor.

### Participant 22
1. Deepfakes, prejudiced algorithms, and the propagation of incorrect data on the internet are the most harmful technology, twist public sentiment, and even provoke aggression. These factors can result in genuine damage such as bias, political disruption, and even physical harm.

2. The second-most harmful technology-related harm are privacy and security breaches. As the integration of technology deepens in our daily lives, the risk of data breaches and privacy infringements escalates. This can result in identity theft, financial setbacks, and even emotional turmoil.

3. The third-most harmful technology-related harm is job displacement through automation. Automation is progressively substituting human laborers across different industries. Although this can result in enhanced effectiveness and output, it can also result in unemployment and economic difficulties for those who are displaced.

### Participant 23
1. When I was in middle school an eleven friend of mine called me and talked negatively about another friend.  I went along with what she was saying.  At the end of the call the girl we were discussing joined the conversation.  Three way calling was a very new tool and I did not expect her to be on the call.  I felt terrible.

2. In art school I was making a frame to pull canvas over for a painting.  I cut partially into the 2x4 and then began to chisel out a notch.  I was exerting great pressure on the chisel when it slipped and I stabbed my other hand.  Bled everywhere, was very painful and I still have a scar.

3. I was a manager at a restaurant and I was opening.  I had the keys and no one could get in without me.  The restaurant opened 45 min late because I kept hitting the snooze on my alarm.

### Participant 24
1. The most harmful technology loss I experienced was when I lost my I sold my laptop and didn’t back it up first.  I was making videos and doing production of elearning in a time when it was really hard to find people with that skill.

2. The second most harmful loss was when I lost access to Dropbox for my work files.  I was developing courses and lost all source files, and thus lost the ability to edit courses.

3. The third most harmful was when my iPod broke.  It seemed inconsequential but it was not.  Music is therapy for me, and at the time, going to actual therapy was not as normalized.  I had just gotten married and didn’t realize that I was going to experience several personal tragedies.  Not having my music was really detrimental to my mental health and my productivity.
