### Participant 7
1. The most harmful technology related harm or loss is my loss of time. Its so easy to get lost doom scrolling and next thing you know your day has passed by without you even noticing what has happened around me. This often then causes great distress as you feel as though you accomplished nothing on your day off or didn&#39;t truly get to relax as you were engaged heavily the whole day mentally and so I believe it has contributed to more stress in my life.
2. *Participant matched this with* **Mental Health**

2. I placed an order on a website that was not a legit website, it seemed ok but after the order was placed I realized it was a fake site meant to duplicate another one. I was able to do a chargeback for the order but I had concern about any stolen personal information for awhile.
