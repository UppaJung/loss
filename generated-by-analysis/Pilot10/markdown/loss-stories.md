### Participant 7
1. The most harmful technology related harm or loss is my loss of time. Its so easy to get lost doom scrolling and next thing you know your day has passed by without you even noticing what has happened around me. This often then causes great distress as you feel as though you accomplished nothing on your day off or didn&#39;t truly get to relax as you were engaged heavily the whole day mentally and so I believe it has contributed to more stress in my life.
2. *Participant matched this with* **Mental Health**
The second most harmful tech related harm would just be self confidence that is so tied to technology and especially social media that is connected to all of this. So often what I feel like that day is tied to my technology.

I had significant amounts of code and code artifacts on the machine that I had not backed up because I had been unable to successfully complete the git merge because of diff errors.  Once I had a replacement machine, I spent about a year trying to recreate the missing code and code artifacts.
2. I lost my cellphone while on vacation in a foreign country. Luckily, since I did not have cell coverage in the country and still had my laptop, I was able to connect to wifi and order a replacement phone that arrived at my house shortly after I returned home. I was also able to continue my vacation mostly uninterrupted.
3. *Participant matched this with* **Breached Device, Lost Photos**

### Participant 20
1. *Participant matched this with* **Mental Health**
The most harmful technology-related harm I have experienced would be increased sleep deprivation and dependency on my phone. I received my first phone when I was in 6th grade and would stay up late scrolling, watching videos, and playing games. This habit has lessened since then but I am still heavily dependent on my phone and this often leads to me procrastinating on assignments and staying up late for no reason.
2. *Participant matched this with* **Mental Health**
The second-most harmful technology-related harm I have experienced would be comparison to other people on social media. Having access to social media as young as I was had negative impacts on my mental health growing up.

One of the most harmful technology related losses I&#39;ve experienced was when a critical component of a rescue radio system I developed malfunctioned during a field test, delaying a rescue operation and potentially jeopardizing lives. This incident emphasized the importance of thorough testing and continuous improvement in mission-critical technology development.
2. *Participant matched this with* **Breached Social, Breached Financial, Broken Promise, Mental Health**
Early in life was getting hacked in the online game &quot;&quot;RuneScape.&quot;&quot; A person I trusted, whom I believed was a friend, betrayed my trust and stole most of my in-game items. This incident not only resulted in a significant loss of virtual possessions but also shattered my sense of security and trust in online interactions. It was a harsh lesson about the dangers of naively trusting others online and the importance of safeguarding personal information and accounts. This was right around the time of the Varrock massacre on 06/06/06. That&#39;s how old school I&#39;m talking.

One of the most impactful turning points in my life occurred in 2014 after a traumatic incident involving the theft of my phone by a drug dealer who then assaulted me.

Despite the physical and emotional toll of the assault, it served as a catalyst for positive change, marking the beginning of my journey towards recovery and a healthier lifestyle.
