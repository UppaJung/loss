<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 19px;"><b>Introduction</b></span><br>
In this survey we will ask you to recall and describe up to three experiences in which you suffered significant harm or loss due to your reliance on technology.&nbsp;The harms or losses could be recent or could have occurred long ago.</p><br>
Please be sure not to share any information in their responses that could identify yourself or others.<br>
